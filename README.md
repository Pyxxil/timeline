# Timeline (Work in Progress)

Inspired by [app-ideas]() repository, and their Advanced idea for creating a timeline that can display a users [GitHub history](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/3-Advanced/GitHub-Timeline-App.md), I decided to challenge myself even further.

Timeline is a small web application that strives to not only allow a user to easily display their history, it allows them to export the timeline they create so that they can add it to their own sites/apps.
